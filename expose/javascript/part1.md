1. values added: 20
Explanation: On line 9 of the function sumValues, the code console.log('values added: ', result); is intended to print the sum of num1 and num2 to the console if add is true. In this specific example, since add is true and the function sumValues is called with sumValues(10, 10, true), the variables num1 and num2 are 10 each.

2. final result: 20
Explanation: On line 13, console.log('final result: ', result); attempts to log the variable result outside of its block scope (defined within the if block). Since var has function scope, it is accessible throughout the entire function even outside the block where it is declared. However, since result is only assigned a value within the if block, its value outside the block at line 13 depends on whether the if condition was true. In this case, it was true, so result retains the value calculated within the if block, which is 20.

Note: If the condition if (add) were false, result would not be initialized to any value, but since var is hoisted and initialized as undefined, the output would instead be: 

final result: undefined

3. values added: 20
Explanation: In the given code snippet, line 9 executes within an if block where add is true. Here, result is declared with let within the same block and is properly initialized and modified before being used in the console.log statement. Therefore, there will be no error.

4. ReferenceError: result is not defined
Explanation: Since result is declared with let inside the if block, it is scoped only to that block. Attempting to access it outside of the if block in line 13 will result in an error because result is not defined in that scope. Therefore, the code will throw a ReferenceError when trying to log result on line 13.

5. Nothing is printed because a TypeError occurs at line 7, halting the execution before reaching line 9.

6. Nothing is printed because the execution is halted due to the error on line 7. The console.log statement on line 13 is never reached.
